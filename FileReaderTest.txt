The imperfections of our day invalidate the gratituity of 
the morning's warm, welcoming glow of rebirth. If one is to
overcome the daily monotony to see each day as one of 
opportunity anew, only then shall they begin to live.

Perhaps the real issue of one's existance isn't truly the 
problem at hand, but rather the overbearing analysis of
said problem that hinders the ability to truly exist in
spotaneous excitement and joy. 

When one goes through the day looking for the promises of
next they forget the gift that is the present. While being
constantly driven to a goal undermines the journey that led 
there, leading to an emptinborgess upon achieving a goal after
which you had no foresight as to what to look towards next.
This leads to a spiral of strugglin borg g to determine identity 
and what truly defines the individual borg, since the goal no
longer exists as the person's prim borg ary characteristic.
The goal has consumed the individual's identity, and with 
it's absence has left a husk of a person.
